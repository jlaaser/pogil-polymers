\begin{model}[Chain Chemistry]
\label{\labelbase:mdl:backsideend}

	When describing the chemistry of polymer chains, the three most important components of the molecule are the \emph{backbone}, the \emph{sidechains}, and the \emph{end groups}, as shown schematically below:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_schematic.pdf}}

\end{model}


\begin{ctqs}

	\question Which of these components (backbone, sidechains, or end groups)...
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ... contain the bonds and/or functional groups that make up the ``main chain'' that spans from one end of the polymer to the other?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.25in]
					backbone
				\end{solution}
			
			\item ... contain the functional groups that are attached to every repeat unit but are not part of unbroken string of bonds connecting one end of the polymer to the other?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.25in]
					sidechains
				\end{solution}
			
			\item ... ``cap'' the ends of the polymer chain?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.25in]
					end groups
				\end{solution}
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question The structure of a polystyrene chain is given below:
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_PS}}
	
		For this polymer, identify and sketch the structures of...
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item the backbone:
			
				\begin{solution}[0.75in]\studentdisplay{
					~
				}\instructordisplay{
					The backbone contains the string of C-C bonds highlighted below:
					
					\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_PS_backbone_soln}}
				}\end{solution}
			
			\item the sidechains:
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]\studentdisplay{
					~
				}\instructordisplay{
					The sidechains consist of the aromatic rings, as highlighted below:
					
					\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.075\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_PS_sidechain_soln}}
				}\end{solution}
			
			\item the end groups:
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]\studentdisplay{
					~
				}\instructordisplay{
					The end groups are a sec-butyl group (left) and a hydrogen atom (right), as indicated below:
					
					\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_PS_endgrps_soln}}
				}\end{solution}
			
			
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question Polystyrene is produced from the styrene monomer,
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_styrene}}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Upon polymerization, which bond from this monomer is incorporated into the backbone of the polymer chain?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
				
					The double bond is converted to a single bond and incorporated into the backbone of the chain.
					
				\end{solution}
				
			\item How is the structure of the repeat unit related to the structure of this monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
				
					They have the same chemical formula and connectivity of the atoms, but the double bond in the monomer is replaced by a single bond in the polymer, and new bonds are formed to connect the monomer to the adjacent repeat units.
					
				\end{solution}
				
			\item How is the name of the polymer related to the name of this monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
				
					The name of the polymer is just poly( name of the monomer ).
					
				\end{solution}
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question Two other common polymers, and the monomers used to produce them, are shown below:
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_polymermonomertable}}
		
		Based on these structures, critique or defend each of the following statements in 2-3 complete sentences:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \emph{``Polymer chains always have backbones consisting of only C-C single bonds.''}
			
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					FALSE - clearly not true for PET!
				\end{solution}
			
			\item \emph{``Polymers are always named for the monomer from which they are produced.''}
			
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					FALSE - also clearly not true for PET!
				\end{solution}
			
		\end{enumerate}

\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	Polymers are typically named for their ``constituent repeat unit.''
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}

	\question The structure of ethylene terephthalate is shown below:
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_ethyleneterephthalate}}
		
		Is this structure consistent with the rule given in the above information box?  Briefly explain your group's reasoning.
		
		\begin{solution}[0.75in]
			Yes, it is.  This molecule has the same structure as the repeat unit of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) molecule, with only one bond needing to be broken/re-formed to link to adjacent repeat units.
			
			Note that IUPAC specifies clear rules for how the constituent repeat unit is named, which the above examples do not follow - we have given the ``common names'' for the repeat units rather than their IUPAC names.  See DOI 10.1351/PAC-REP-12-03-05 for a brief guide to IUPAC nomenclature.

\begin{model}[Composition]
\label{\labelbase:mdl:composition}

	The polymers shown in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:backsideend} contain only one type of repeat unit.  However, it is also possible to produce polymers with multiple types of repeat units.  These polymers are usually classified in terms of how many distinct repeat units they contain, and how those repeat units are distributed throughout the chain.
	
	Several common classes of polymers are illustrated below:
	
	{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.75}
	\begin{tabular}{m{0.78in}m{2in}m{2.5in}}
		\hline
		Classification & Repeat Unit Distribution & Example\\

\begin{model}[Isomerism]

	Even when polymers consist of only a single monomer, sometimes that monomer can be incorporated into the polymer chain in different ways.  This results in \textit{isomerism} in the polymer chain.  Three common types of isomerism are illustrated below:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Positional isomerism:
		
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figpath/Model3_positional}}
		
		\item Stereoisomerism:
		
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figpath/Model3_stereo}}
		
		\item Geometric isomerism:

				\begin{solution}[1in]
				\end{solution}
