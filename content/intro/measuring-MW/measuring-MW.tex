\begin{model}[End Group Analysis]
\label{\labelbase:mdl:endgrpanalysis}

	One simple method for determining the molecular weight of a polymer is by \emph{end-group analysis}.
	
	To employ end-group analysis, the end-group(s) on each polymer chain must have a chemical or physical feature that can be detected and quantified independently of the rest of the polymer chain, as depicted below:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1-endgrp-schematic}}

\end{model}


\begin{ctqs}

	\question How many end groups are shown in the polymer sample depicted in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:endgrpanalysis}?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.25in]{}
			4
		\end{solution}
	
	\question How many monomers are shown in the polymer sample depicted in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:endgrpanalysis}?
	
		\emph{Note: for the purposes of this question, do not count the end group beads as monomers.}
	
		\begin{solution}[0.25in]{}
			12
		\end{solution}
	
	\question Calculate the average degree of polymerization of the polymer sample depicted in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:endgrpanalysis} by dividing your answer to part (b) by your answer from part (a).  If each monomer has a mass of 100~g/mol, what is the average molecular weight of this polymer sample?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]{}
			degree of polymerization: 12/4 = 3
			
			molecular weight: 3(100 g/mol) = 300 g/mol
		\end{solution}
	
	\question Is the molecular weight you determined in the previous question $M_n$ or $M_w$?  Briefly explain your group's reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences.
	
		\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
			This molecular weight is the number-average molecular weight, $M_n$.  Recall that $N_n$ is always calculated as the number of monomers divided by the number of chains.  Since there is one end group per chain, dividing the number of monomers by the number of end groups is the same as dividing the number of monomers by the number of chains, and gives $N_n$.  The molecular weight calculated from this degree of polymerization is thus $M_n$.
		\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}

	One popular experimental method used for end-group analysis is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
	
	In NMR spectroscopy, each unique ``type'' of proton in a polymer has a different chemical shift, and the intensity of the signal measured by the spectrometer at each chemical shift is directly proportional to the number of protons of the corresponding type.

\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
		
	\question Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether has two unique types of protons, as shown below:
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1-PEG}}
		
		\vspace{-8pt}
		The protons inside the repeat unit (red) are \emph{methylene} protons, while the protons on the end groups (blue) are \emph{methyl} protons.
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item How many methylene protons does this polymer have?  Give your answer in terms of the number of repeat units, $n$.
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]{}
					4n
				\end{solution}
			
			\item How many methyl protons does this polymer have?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]{}
					6
				\end{solution}
			
			\item The intensity measured in NMR, $I$, is proportional to the number of protons of each type.  That is, 
				\begin{align*}
					I_{methylene} &= A \times (\text{\# of methylene protons})\\
					I_{methyl} &= A \times (\text{\# of methyl protons})
				\end{align*}
				so
				\begin{equation*}
					\frac{I_{methylene}}{I_{methyl}} = \frac{\text{\# of methylene protons}}{\text{\# of methyl protons}}
				\end{equation*}
				Substitute your answers to parts (a) and (b) into this expression, and then solve for $n$ in terms of the ratio $\frac{I_{methylene}}{I_{methyl}}$.
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]{}
					\begin{align*}
						\frac{I_{methylene}}{I_{methyl}} = \frac{4n}{6}=\frac{2n}{3} && \text{so} && n = \frac{3}{2}\frac{I_{methylene}}{I_{methyl}}
					\end{align*}
				\end{solution}
				
			\item Suppose an NMR measurement on poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether yields the following intensities for the methylene and methyl protons, respectively:
				\begin{align*}
					I_{methylene}=90 && \text{and} &&
					I_{methyl}=3
				\end{align*}
				Based on this information, and the approach you explored above, what must the degree of polymerization and the molecular weight of the polymer be?
				
				\emph{Note: for ethylene glycol, each (\ce{CH2CH2O}) repeat unit is composed of a single monomer with mass $M_0=44\text{ g/mol}$.}
				
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
					Using the calculation from the previous part, we find that $n = (3/2)(90/3) = 45$.
					
					Multiplying by 44 g/mol, we obtain $M_n = (44\text{ g/mol})(45) = 2.0\text{ kg/mol}$.
				\end{solution}
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\question Briefly summarize how you could use NMR to determine the molecular weight of a polymer sample, if you are given its chemical structure.
		
			\begin{solution}[2in]{}
			
				\begin{enumerate}				
					\item First, identify at least one unique type of proton on the end group and at least one unique type of proton on the repeat unit.  Count how many of each type of proton there are, making sure to multiply the number for the protons on the repeat unit by $n$.
				
					\item Second, look up the chemical shifts for both types of protons and locate the corresponding peaks in the NMR spectrum.  Write down the integrals of the relevant peaks.
				
					\item Third, set up an appropriate ratio (as we did in the previous question) and solve for the number of repeat units, $n$.
				
					\item Finally, multiply by the molecular weight of the repeat unit to obtain the molecular weight of the polymer.
				\end{enumerate}
				 
			\end{solution}
		
		\question It is difficult to determine the intensities of peaks in NMR spectra accurately if they are less than about 1\% of the intensity of the largest peaks.  Do you expect this to place any limits on the range of molecular weights that can be quantified by NMR?  Briefly explain your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences.
		
			\begin{solution}[2in]{}
				Yes, this will limit the range of molecular weights that can be quantified by NMR.  If it is difficult to detect intensities of less than 1\%, then practically speaking, it will be difficult to quantify the number of end group protons when there are more than about 100 repeat units (though this limit may be larger or smaller depending on the number of protons contributing to each NMR peak).  For most polymers, this will limit the accessible range of molecular weights to around 10-20~kg/mol.
			\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}



\begin{model}[MALDI Mass Spectrometry]
	\label{\labelbase:mdl:MALDI}

	As you learned in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:endgrpanalysis}, end group analysis yields the number-average molecular weight of the polymer.  Often, however, it is more useful to measure the \emph{full distribution} of molecular weights.
	
	One technique that can be used to measure the full distribution of molecular weights is \emph{matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry}.  In this approach, depicted below, the polymer sample is deposited on a metal target.  A laser is then used to desorb individual polymer chains from the surface and ionize them (give them a charge):   
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-MALDIschematic}}
	
	The ionized polymer chains are then passed into a \emph{mass spectrometer}, which separates them by their mass-to-charge ratios, $m/z$.  The resulting mass spectrum contains a peak at each measured mass-to-charge ratio, with the intensity of each peak proportional to the number of chains with that value of $m/z$. 

\end{model}

\begin{ctqs}

	\question Suppose a polymer sample contains the following four polymer chains: \label{\labelbase:ctq:PS-MALDI}
	
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-PSmz}}
	
		Plot the mass spectrum that you would measure for this sample (i.e. number of chains as a function of mass-to-charge ratio) on the following axes.  Make sure to clearly indicate that the number of chains is zero for any m/z values not present in the sample.
		
			%\vspace{12pt}
			\begin{solution}[2in]{\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-axes-v1}}}
				\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-axes-v1-soln}}
			\end{solution}
			
	\question The mass spectrum you plotted in the previous question should have sharp peaks at three different $m/z$ ratios.
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Calculate the \emph{difference} in the $m/z$ values for each adjacent pair of peaks.
			
				\begin{solution}[0.75in]{}
					Each pair of peaks is separated by 104.0 or 104.1 mass units
				\end{solution}
			
			\item How is the gap between peaks that you calculated in part (a) related to the molecular weight of the repeat unit in this polymer?
			
				\emph{Hint: remember that for styrene, $M_0 = 104\text{ g/mol}$!}
			
				\begin{solution}[0.75in]{}
					The gap is equal to the repeat unit molecular weight.
				\end{solution}
			
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question Assuming each polymer chain has only a single charge, $m/z$ for a polymer chain is equal to its mass $M_i$.
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Re-draw the mass spectrum you sketched in CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:PS-MALDI} on the following axes:
		
			\begin{solution}[2in]{\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-axes-v2}}}
				\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{\figpath/Model2-axes-v2-soln}}
			\end{solution}
			
			\item Recall that the number-average and weight-average molecular weights of a polymer sample can be expressed as
		\begin{align*}
			M_n = \frac{\sum_i n_i M_i}{\sum_i n_i} && M_w = \frac{\sum_i n_i M_i^2}{\sum_i n_i M_i}
		\end{align*}
		where $n_i$ is the number of chains with length $i$ and $M_i$ is the mass of each chain that has length $i$.
		
				Using these equations, and the mass spectrum you sketched in the previous part, calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$ for this polymer sample in the space on the next page.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		%(calculation space, cont'd $\rightarrow$)
		\begin{solution}[3.5in]{}
			\begin{align*}
				M_n &= \frac{1\cdot 266.2 + 2\cdot 370.3 + 1\cdot 474.3}{1 + 2 + 1} = 370.3\\
				M_w &= \frac{1\cdot 266.2^2 + 2\cdot 370.3^2 + 1\cdot 474.3^2}{1\cdot 266.2 + 2\cdot 370.3 + 1\cdot 474.3} = 384.9
			\end{align*}
		\end{solution}
		
	\question Briefly summarize, in 2-3 complete sentences, how you could use a MALDI spectrum to obtain information about each of the following:
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ... the molecular weight and dispersity of a polymer sample?
			
		\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
		
			To determine the molecular weight and dispersity of the polymer sample, we would first calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$  using the equations above, where we put in the $m/z$ values as the $M_i$ values and the heights (or intensities) of the peaks in place of the corresponding $n_i$ values.  This works because for singly-charged polymers, the mass of the chain is just directly equal to $m/z$, and the intensity of the peaks in MALDI are directly proportional to the number of molecules with the corresponding mass.  We would then just divide $M_w$ by $M_n$ to get the dispersity.
			
		\end{solution}
				
			\item ... the repeat unit of a polymer if you \emph{did not} already know its structure?
			
		\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
		
			To get information about the repeat unit of the polymer, we would need to look at the spacing between the peaks.  The spacing between peaks should be equal to the molecular weight of one repeat unit.
			
			Note that this does not give us any information about the \emph{structure} of the repeat unit - for that, we'd need to characterize the polymer by NMR as well - but it would help us narrow down the possibilities by a lot!
		
		\end{solution}
		
		\end{enumerate}
		
	%\question It is typically much easier to ionize smaller polymer molecules than it is to ionize larger polymer molecules.

\begin{model}[Size-Exclusion Chromatography]
\label{\labelbase:mdl:SEC}
	
	Another popular approach to measuring the full distribution of molecular weights is \emph{size-exclusion chromatography} (SEC).
	In an SEC experiment, a solution of the polymer of interest is passed through a column containing a gel with many small pores:
	
	\vspace{12pt}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{\figpath/Model3-SEC}}
	
	As depicted in this image, small/compact polymer chains are able to get into many of the pores in the gel, while large polymer chains may be excluded from some or all of the pores on the basis of their size.

\end{model}

\begin{ctqs}

	\question Based on the image shown in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:SEC}, which type polymer (smaller or larger) travels a longer path as it passes through the gel?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]{}
			smaller
		\end{solution}
	
	\question Based on your answer to the previous question, which type of polymer (smaller or larger) do you expect to take longer to elute (make it to the end of the column)?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]{}
			smaller
		\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	One of the most common types of detectors for an SEC instrument is a \emph{differential refractometer}.  The signal measured by this detector is proportional to the \emph{total mass} of polymer coming off the column at each elution time.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	
	\question Suppose a polymer sample contains 1~g of 30~kg/mol polystyrene, and 2~g of 100~kg/mol polystyrene.  On the following axes, sketch the shape of the SEC trace you would expect to measure for this sample.  Make sure to clearly label each peak with the molecular weight of the polymer to which it corresponds.

		\end{solution}
	
	\question Propose methods that you could use to...
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ... determine a calibration that would allow you to convert the x axis of this plot from elution time to molecular weight:
	
				\begin{solution}[1in]{}
					You could inject a series of polymers with known molecular weights and plot the resulting elution time vs. molecular weight.  You could then fit this data to an appropriate function(*) to make a calibration curve.
					
					(*) Retention time (and retention volume) have a logarithmic dependence on molecular weight, so the correct functional form is typically $V_R = A - B \log M$.
					
				\end{solution}
			
			\item ... convert the y axis from mass to number of chains:
	
				\begin{solution}[1in]{}
					You would divide the total mass of polymer at each elution time by the molecular weight \emph{corresponding to that elution time}.
				\end{solution}
			
			\item ... calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$ from an SEC trace:
	
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
					Once the axes have been converted to $M_i$ and $n_i$ as described above, you could just use the expressions for $M_n$ and $M_w$ from earlier in the activity, where the sum would be over \emph{each data point} in the SEC trace.
				\end{solution}
		
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\clearpage
	\question The size of a polymer chain in solution depends not only on the mass of the chain, but also on how favorable the polymer/solvent interaction is.  In a ``good'' solvent, a polymer chain will swell/expand to a larger size, while in a ``poor'' solvent, a polymer chain will deswell/contract to a smaller size.
	
		Based on this information, do you expect the same calibration to be valid for polymers with different chemical structures?  Briefly explain your group's reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences.		
	
			\begin{solution}[1.5in]{}
				No.  Suppose the calibration is calculated using a polymer for which the SEC solvent is a good solvent.  If we then analyze a different polymer, for which the SEC solvent is a poor solvent, the chains will be more compact and will take longer to elute from the column than chains of the same molecular weight did when we measured the calibration curve.  As a result, our calibration would determine the molecular weight of the polymer to be much lower than it actually is.
				
				While there are ways around this problem (e.g. universal calibration, using a light scattering detector in addition to a differential refractometer, etc.), the calibration should ideally be measured using known standards for each polymer/solvent pair.
			\end{solution}
	
	% \question Would also like a qualitative question about how peak shape relates to dispersity, but am not sure it fits in easily here - save for exercises?
	
	% \question Would also like a qualitative question about the relative resolution of SEC vs. MALDI, and fact that SEC can get to higher molecular weights...
	
\end{ctqs}


\begin{exercises}

	\exercise Similar to NMR, UV-vis can also be used to perform end group analysis on polymer samples.  In a UV-vis experiment, the measured absorbance ($A$) of a functional group is
		\begin{equation*}
			A = \epsilon c l
		\end{equation*}
		where $l$ is the thickness of the sample, $c$ is the concentration of the functional group of interest, and $\epsilon$ is the extinction coefficient of the functional group at the wavelength at which the absorbance is measured.
		
		The following polymer, for example, contains a trithiocarbonate group (S(C=S)S,  highlighted in red), which has an extinction coefficient of about 18,500~L~mol\textsuperscript{-1}~cm\textsuperscript{-1} at 305~nm:
		
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{\figpath/Exc-UVvis-polymer}}
		
		Suppose a 1.2~mg sample of this polymer is dissolved in 1.0 mL of chloroform and placed in a 1~cm thick sample cell.  If the measured absorbance at 305~nm is 0.85, what must the molecular weight of the polymer be?
		
		\begin{solution}{}
			We first need to solve for the number of end groups in the sample.  Rearranging the equation given in the problem, and using the given values for $A$, $l$, and $\epsilon$, we find that the concentration of end groups was
			\begin{equation*}
				c = \frac{A}{\epsilon l} = \frac{0.85}{(18,500\text{ L~mol\textsuperscript{-1}~cm\textsuperscript{-1}})(1\text{ cm})} = 4.6\times10^{-5}\text{ mol/L}
			\end{equation*}
			Since the total solution volume was 1~mL, then the total number of end groups was $4.6\times10^{-5}\text{ mmol}$.
			
			Next, we need to figure out how many monomers there were in the solution.  Since the styrene unit has a mass of 104 g/mol, the number of monomers in solution is (1.2 mg)/(104 g/mol) = 0.0115 mmol.
			
			Then, dividing number of monomers by number of chains, we find that the degree of polymerization is (0.0115 mmol)/($4.6\times10^{-5}\text{ mmol}$) = 250.
			
			Finally, multiplying the degree of polymerization by the monomer mass (104 g/mol), we find that the molecular weight of the polymer was (250)(104 g/mol) = 26 kg/mol.
			
			Notes:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item In the above solution, we first divided by the mass of the styrene unit and then multiplied by it again.  Since these end up canceling out, we could just take a shortcut, and divide the mass of polymer directly by the number of moles of end groups to obtain the molecular weight - e.g. (1.2~mg)/(0.000046 mmol) = 26 kg/mol.  However, students may find it helpful to write out all the steps (above) to better connect to their understanding of what $M_n$ means.
					\item Because this molecular weight was obtained by end-group analysis, this is the \emph{number-average} molecular weight, not the weight-average molecular weight.
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{solution}
		
	
	\exercise Another technique used to quantify the molecular weights of polymers is light scattering.  In a light scattering experiment, the intensity of the signal from each polymer chain is proportional to the molecular weight of the chain.
	
		Based on this information, do you expect the molecular weight obtained from a light scattering measurement to be $M_n$ or $M_w$?  Explain your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences.
		
		\begin{solution}{}
			Recall that the average for $M_n$ counts each chain once, while the average for $M_w$ counts each chain once \emph{for each monomer it contains}.  Because the intensity of the signal from each polymer chain in a light scattering measurement is proportional to the molecular weight of the chain, and because molecular weight is proportional to number of monomers, the light scattering intensity effectively counts each chain once for each monomer it contains.  As a result, the obtained average molecular weight will be the \emph{weight-average} molecular weight.

	% \exercise A question getting students to think about why the TOF part of MALDI-TOF works to separate polymers by mass
	
	% \exercise A question getting students to think about how/why the fact that it is easier to ionize smaller chains affects MALDI interpretation
	
	\exercise Ionizing hydrophobic polymers such as polystyrene can be difficult.  To solve this problem, the polymers are often complexed with an ion such as silver.
	
		How would you expect the presence of a silver ion to change the mass spectrum you sketched in CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:PS-MALDI}?  Briefly explain your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences.
		
		\begin{solution}{}
			If each chain complexes with a silver ion, then the mass we detect will be (mass of chain + mass of silver ion) rather than just (mass of chain).  Thus, the entire mass spectrun should shift toward higher $m/z$ values by the mass of one silver ion, which is nominally 108 amu.
			
			Some students may note that silver has two stable isotopes (\textsuperscript{107}Ag and \textsuperscript{109}Ag), which are present in approximately equal amounts in naturally-occurring samples.  If we measured the spectrum with a super high resolution mass spectrometer, this means that the spectrum should actually be ``doubled'', with one ``copy'' of the spectrum at 107 mass units higher than the mass of the chains, and another 2 mass units higher.  In practice, however, MALDI instruments don't usually have high enough resolution to see this effect.
