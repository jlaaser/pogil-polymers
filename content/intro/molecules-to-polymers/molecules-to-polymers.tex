\begin{infobox}
	For convenience, large molecules with repeating structures are often abbreviated using the following notation:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=2]{\figpath/Model1_nrepeats.pdf}}
	
	Here, the repeat unit is enclosed in parentheses.  The repeat units are attached end-to-end, and the subscript $n$ indicates how many times this unit is repeated.  The portions outside of the parentheses are not part of the repeat unit, and indicate the chemical structure of the end-groups that ``cap'' the end of the molecule.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	\question Draw the full structure of the molecule shown in the following abbreviated structure: \label{\labelbase:ctq:abbrevbutane}
	
		\vspace{6pt}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=2]{\figpath/Model1_C10_abbreviated.pdf}}
		
		\begin{solution}[1.25in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question Propose an analogous abbreviated structure for the 100-carbon linear alkane described in CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:100Calkane}: \label{\labelbase:ctq:abbrev100}
		
		\begin{solution}[0.75in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question What is the chemical formula \emph{of the repeat unit} for the structures in CTQs \ref{\labelbase:ctq:abbrevbutane} and \ref{\labelbase:ctq:abbrev100}?
		
		\begin{solution}[0.75in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question What small molecule has the same chemical formula as this repeat unit?
		
		\begin{solution}[0.75in]
		\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	When the number of repeat units is large, we often describe molecules with repeating structures as \emph{polymers}.  The word polymer comes from Greek: \emph{poly} means ``many'', while \emph{meros} means ``parts''.  Thus, a \emph{polymer} is a molecule composed of \emph{many} (often identical) \emph{parts}.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	\question Why might we describe molecules of the form
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=2]{\figpath/Model1_nrepeats.pdf}}
			
		as \emph{polyethylenes}?  Explain your answer in 1-2 complete sentences.

	\question Consider a sample of ethane molecules.  What type(s) of interactions (e.g. covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, etc.) do you expect to govern interactions between these molecules?%, and why?  %Briefly explain your team's reasoning.

	\question The melting temperature of polyethylene is typically quoted as approximately 120~${}^\circ$C.  In your group's judgment, how many carbon atoms are necessary before the melting behavior begins to ``look'' more like the polymer than like a small molecule?  Explain your choice in 2-3 complete sentences. \label{\labelbase:ctq:npolymer}

\begin{exercises}

	\exercise How many repeat units does the number of carbon atoms you identified in CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:npolymer} correspond to?

	\exercise In this class, we will primarily use the word ``polymer'' to describe large molecules with repeating structures.  Another word commonly used in this field, however, is ``macromolecule''.  Why is this also a reasonable term for describing this class of molecules, and does it capture any important features that are missed by the word ``polymer''?
