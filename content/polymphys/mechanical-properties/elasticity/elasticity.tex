\begin{model}[Stretching a Piece of Polymer]
	\label{\labelbase:mdl:macrostretch}

	To understand the properties of polymeric materials, we need to build from our understanding of the force required to extend a single polymer chain to the force required to stretch a macroscopic piece of a polymeric material.
	
	A simple model for the deformation of a macroscopic piece of polymer is shown below:
	
	\vspace{6pt}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_extension.pdf}}
	
	Usually, because we would like to look at properties that don't depend on the exact dimensions of the sample we are studying, we work in terms of the \emph{ratios} of the final dimensions of the sample to the initial dimensions.
	
	For the sample shown above, the extension ratios are:
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda_x = \frac{L_x}{L_0} && \lambda_y = \frac{L_y}{L_0} && \lambda_z = \frac{L_z}{L_0}
	\end{align*}
	These relationships allow us to write the final dimensions of the sample as
	\begin{align*}
		L_x = \lambda_x L_0 && L_y = \lambda_y L_0 && L_z = \lambda_z L_0
	\end{align*}
	
\end{model}


\begin{ctqs}

	\question First, consider the properties of the macroscopic sample.
	
		\begin{enumerate}
		
			\item What is the volume of the polymer sample depicted in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:macrostretch} before it is stretched?  Give your answer in terms of $L_0$.
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]
		
			$V = L_0^3$
		\end{solution}
	
			\item What is the volume of the polymer sample after it is stretched? Give your answer in terms of $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$.
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]
		
			$V = L_x L_y L_z$
		\end{solution}
	
			\item There is usually no change in volume when we deform a bulk polymer network.  Write a mathematical relationship expressing this fact.
		\label{\labelbase:ctq:equalvolumes}
	
		\begin{solution}[0.5in]
			$L_0^3 = L_x L_y L_z$
		\end{solution}
		
			\item Use this information in Model \ref{\labelbase:mdl:macrostretch} to rewrite your the relationship from CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:equalvolumes} in terms of $\lambda_x$, $\lambda_y$, and $\lambda_z$, and simplify as much as possible.
	
		\begin{solution}[1.5in]
			\begin{align*}
				L_0^3 &= (\lambda_x L_0)(\lambda_y L_0)(\lambda_z L_0) \\
				L_0^3 & = \lambda_x \lambda_y \lambda_z L_0^3 \\
				1 &= \lambda_x \lambda_y \lambda_z
			\end{align*}
		\end{solution}
		
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\question Next, consider the properties of a single polymer strand within the material.
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			
			\item If the polymer strand initially has end-to-end vector $\vec h_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$, what do you expect its final end-to-end vector $\vec h$ will be, if the polymer strand stretches by the same ratios that the macroscopic sample does?  
			
			\emph{(Note: this assumption, that the individual chains stretch by the same ratios as the macroscopic sample, is referred to as \emph{affine deformation}.)}
		
			\begin{solution}[1in]
				$\vec h = (\lambda_x x_0, \lambda_y y_0, \lambda_z z_0)$
			\end{solution}
			
			\item Recall that when a single strand of polymer is stretched from end-to-end distance $h$ to end-to-end distance $h_0$, its change in entropy is 
			\begin{equation*}
				\Delta S_{strand} = -k\left(\frac{3}{2Nb^2}\right)(h^2 - h_0^2)
			\end{equation*}
			 What is $\Delta S_{strand}$ in terms of $x_0$, $y_0$, $z_0$ and $\lambda_x$, $\lambda_y$, and $\lambda_z$?  Write out all of the terms, but do not worry about simplifying your answer.
		
				\begin{solution}[2.25in]
					\begin{align*}
						\Delta S_{strand} &= -k\left(\frac{3}{2Nb^2}\right)(h^2 - h_0^2)\\
							&= -k\left(\frac{3}{2Nb^2}\right)\left(\left(((\lambda_x x_0)^2 + (\lambda_y y_0)^2 + (\lambda_z z_0)^2\right) - \left(x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2\right)\right)
					\end{align*}
				\end{solution}
				
		\end{enumerate}
				
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}

	For the rest of this activity, we will consider \emph{uniaxial} extension, in which $\lambda_x \equiv \lambda$ and $\lambda_y = \lambda_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ (these latter two relationships are necessary to ensure that the volume of the sample does not change, as you explored in CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:equalvolumes}).  In this case, it is possible to show that
	
		\begin{equation*}	
				\Delta S_{strand} = -\frac{k}{2}\left(\lambda^2 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 3\right)
			\label{\labelbase:eqn:delSstranduniaxial}
		\end{equation*}
			
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
		
	\question Suppose that there are a total of $v_e$ polymer strands that stretch when the material is stretched (we refer to these as ``elastically-effective'' strands). What will the total entropy change of the network ($\Delta S_{network}$) be, in terms of $v_e$, $\lambda$, and any other necessary constants?
		
			\begin{solution}[1.5in]
				\begin{align*}
					\Delta S_{network} &= v_e \Delta S_{strand}\\
						&= -\frac{v_e k}{2}\left(\lambda^2 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 3\right)
				\end{align*}
			\end{solution}
		
	\question Finally, recalling that $f = -T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)$, find an expression for the force required to stretch the material by extension ratio $\lambda$.
	
		\emph{Hint: Because $L = \lambda L_0$, we can also write $f$ as $f = -\frac{T}{L_0}\frac{\partial \Delta S}{\partial \lambda}$, which will be the easier form to use for this problem.}
		
			\begin{solution}[3in]
			
				\begin{align*}
					f &= -\frac{T}{L_0}\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left(-\frac{v_e k}{2}\left(\lambda^2 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 3\right)\right)\\
						&= \frac{T}{L_0}\frac{v_e k}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left(\left(\lambda^2 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 3\right)\right)\\
						&= \frac{v_e k T}{2 L_0}\left(2\lambda - \frac{2}{\lambda^2} \right)\\
						&= \frac{v_e k T}{L_0}\left(\lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \right)
				\end{align*}
			\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}

\begin{model}[Stress and Strain]

	In most experiments, we usually report our data in terms of the \emph{stress} and \emph{strain} on the material, which normalize the force (stress) and change in length (strain) to the initial dimensions of the sample.
	
	The stress and strain are defined as follows:
	\begin{align*}
		\text{stress:} && \sigma = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{initial cross-sectional area}} = \frac{f}{L_0^2} \\
		\text{strain:} && \epsilon = \frac{\text{change in length}}{\text{initial length}} = \frac{L-L_0}{L_0}
	\end{align*}
	
\end{model}

\begin{ctqs}

	\question Write an expression for the stress, $\sigma$, in terms of $v_e$, $\lambda$, $L_0$, and any other necessary constants.
	
		\begin{solution}[0.8in]
			\begin{equation*}
				\sigma = kT\frac{v_e}{L_0^3}\left(\lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right)
			\end{equation*}
		\end{solution}

	\question Write an expression for the strain, $\epsilon$, in terms of $\lambda$ and any other necessary constants.
	
		\begin{solution}[0.8in]
			\begin{equation*}
				\epsilon = \frac{L-L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L}{L_0} -1 = \lambda - 1
			\end{equation*}
		\end{solution}
		
	\question Recall that polymers behave like springs.  Hooke's law states that the relationship between force ($f$) and deformation ($x$) of a spring follows $f=kx$, where $k$ is an appropriate spring constant.
	
		Propose an equivalent relationship for stress and strain, using the \emph{Young's Modulus}, $E$, in place of the spring constant.
		
			\begin{solution}[0.5in]
			
				$\sigma = E\epsilon$
				
			\end{solution}
	
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	For small deformations ($\lambda$ close to 1), it is possible to show that
	\begin{equation*}
		E \approx 3kT\frac{v_e}{V}
	\end{equation*}
	where $v_e$ is the total number of elastically-effective strands, and $V$ is the volume of the sample.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	\question Will the material become easier or harder to stretch as temperature is increased?  Explain your group's reasoning in 1-2 complete sentences.
	
		\begin{solution}[1.5in]
			The solution will become more difficult to stretch as temperature is increased.  Increasing $T$ increases the Young's modulus, which effectively makes the polymer behave as a stiffer spring.
		\end{solution}
	
	\question In 2-3 complete sentences, propose an experiment that you could do to measure the number of elastically-effective chains per unit volume in an unknown polymer sample.
	
		\begin{solution}[1.75in]
		
			To measure the number of elastically-effective chains per unit volume, we could slowly stretch the material while measuring the required force.  We could then convert the measured force at each extension to a stress (and strain), and fit the data to a line.  The slope of this line would give us the Young's modulus, and we could then divide by $3kT$ to get the number of elastically-effective chains per unit volume.
		
		\end{solution}
\end{ctqs}


\begin{exercises}

	\exercise Experimentally, we find that the number of \emph{elastically-effective} strands in a polymer network is always smaller than the \emph{total} number of strands in the network.  Using your knowledge of the structural features of polymer networks, suggest at least one reason that this might be true.
	
		\begin{solution}
			\instructordisplay{Some strands in the polymer network may form loops, which will not stretch when the material is stretched.  These strands will not be elastically effective, making the number of elastically-effective strands smaller than the total number of strands in the network.
			
			Note: alternatively, students may answer in terms of dangling ends, or sol fraction; both of these are also appropriate answers to this question.}

	%\exercise Derive expression for $\Delta S_{strand}$ for uniaxial extension
	
	%\exercise Derive expression for $E$ at low strain
	
	%\exercise analyze experimental tensile data to extract Young's modulus
	
	\exercise Often, it is more useful to think about polymer networks in terms of the average \emph{molecular weight between crosslinks} rather than the number of elastically effective strands per unit volume.
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Suppose your polymer of interest has density $\rho$.  What is the total mass of a sample of volume $V$?
			
				\begin{solution}
					\instructordisplay{$\rho V$}
				\end{solution}
			
			\item How many chains of molecular weight $M_x$ would be contained in a sample of volume $V$?  Give your answer in terms of the  number of individual chains, not just moles of chains.
			
				\begin{solution}
					\instructordisplay{$\frac{N_{av} \rho V}{M_x}$
					
					(note: $N_{av}$ is Avogadro's number)}
				\end{solution}
			
			\item Assuming all of these chains are elastically effective (i.e. that the number you calculated in the previous part is equal to $v_e$), find an expression for the number of elastically effective chains per unit volume in terms of the polymer density, the molecular weight between crosslinks, and any other necessary constants.
			
				\begin{solution}
					\instructordisplay{$\frac{v_e}{V} = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{N_{av} \rho V}{M_x}\right) = \frac{N_{av} \rho}{M_x}$}
				\end{solution}
