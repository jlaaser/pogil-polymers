A quantitative measure of a polymer's stiffness is its \emph{persistence length}, which tells you how far you have to go along the polymer backbone before the chain, on average, turns by 90$^\circ$.
	
		The persistence length is given by
		\begin{equation*}
			l_p = C_\infty \frac{l}{2}
		\end{equation*}

\question Is this information consistent with your answers to questions \ref{\labelbase:ctq:stiffness} and \ref{\labelbase:ctq:C}?

		\exercise In CTQ \ref{\labelbase:ctq:C}, you learned that
		\begin{equation*}
			\langle h^2 \rangle = C_\infty n l^2
		\end{equation*}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Combine this expression with your results from CTQs \ref{\labelbase:ctq:statseg}a and b to find an expression for the statistical segment length, $b$, in terms of $C_\infty$, $n$, $l$, and $R_{max}$.
