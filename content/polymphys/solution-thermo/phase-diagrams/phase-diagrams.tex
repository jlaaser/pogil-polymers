\begin{model}[Free-Energy Curves for Polymer Solutions]

According to Flory-Huggins theory, the free energy of a polymer solution is
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\Delta G_{mix}^{(int)}}{kT} = \phi_1 \phi_2 \chi + \phi_1 \ln \phi_1 + \frac{\phi_2}{N}\ln \phi_2
\end{equation*}
where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the volume fractions of solvent and polymer, respectively, $N$ is the degree of polymerization of the polymer, and $\chi$ is the interaction parameter.

The three terms in this expression, plotted against $\phi_1$ (recall that $\phi_2=1-\phi_1$), have the following individual shapes:

\begin{model}[Free Energy Changes on Phase Separation]

	When a polymer solution is prepared with a specific composition (that is, with a specific value of $\phi_1$), it can either remain a homogeneous, single-phase mixture with composition $\phi_1$, or it can phase separate into two new phases with different compositions, $\phi_{1A}$ and $\phi_{1B}$, as shown below:
	
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{\figpath/model2-schematic}}
	
	%When this phase separation occurs, the \emph{overall} composition of the sample does not change, but the compositions of the individual phases may be somewhat different from that of the starting mixture.
	
	Working through the math, it turns out that the free energy of the phase-separated mixture falls on a line connecting the free energies of the two individual phases:
	
		\vspace{0.1in}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figpath/model2-deltaGphasesep}}
	
	If the free energy of the phase-separated mixture is lower than that of the homogeneous solution, the mixture will phase separate; otherwise, it will remain a single, stable phase.

\begin{ctqs}

		\question \label{ctq:regionconcavity} In what regions of this plot is the free energy curve...

\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	In polymer solutions, there are two different ways we can think about phase separation.
	
	First, if there is \emph{any} way to decrease the free energy by undergoing phase separation, then phase separation must be, overall, thermodynamically favorable.
	
	But separating into two phases with very different compositions requires big changes in the local composition, which can be slow, or kinetically unfavorable.
	
	So the second way to think about phase separation is to look just at the local concavity of the free energy curve.  If it is concave up, then any \emph{small} fluctuations in the local composition will increase the free energy and are unfavorable, so the mixture might not phase separate even if doing so could lower its overall free energy.  We refer to mixtures that are trapped this sort of local minimum as \emph{metastable}.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	\question In which regions of the plot shown in Model 3 do you expect mixtures to...
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ... always phase separate?
			
			\item ... never phase separate?
			
			\item ... be metastable?
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question In 2-3 complete sentences, briefly explain your reasoning for the previous question:
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}
	The points that define the boundaries of the regions that will always spontaneously phase separate are called \emph{spinodal} points.
	
	The points that define the boundaries of the region where phase separation is thermodynamically favorable, even if it might not happen spontaneously, are called \emph{binodal} points.
\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
	\question Locate and label the spinodal points (with an ``S'') and the binodal points (with a ``B'') on the free energy curve shown below:
	
	\question Propose a \emph{mathematical} method that you could use to find the spinodal points of an arbitrary free energy curve.  Describe your procedure in 2-3 complete sentences.
	
		\emph{Hint: remember that in the concave-up regions, $\frac{\partial^2\Delta G}{\partial \phi_1^2} > 0$ and in the concave-down regions, $\frac{\partial^2\Delta G}{\partial \phi_1^2} < 0$.  What must be true about this derivative at the points where the curve transitions between concave up and concave down?}
		
	\question Propose a \emph{graphical} method that you could use to find the binodal points on the free energy curve.  Describe your procedure using 2-3 complete sentences and any diagrams necessary to illustrate your approach.
