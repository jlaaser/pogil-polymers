\section{Degree of Polymerization in Step-Growth Polymerizations}
\renewcommand{\figpath}{content/polymchem/stepgrowth/Mn-and-stoich/figs}

%\textbf{Focus question:} Put a central question for the students to consider through this exercise here.

\subsection{Model 1:  Polymerization of ``AB''-Type Monomers}

The simplest type of step-growth polymerization is one in which each monomer has one ``A''-type reactive group and one ``B''-type reactive group.
These types of monomers are referred to as ``AB''-type monomers.

In each step of the polymerization, an ``A'' group on one molecule reacts with a ``B'' group on another molecule to form an ``ab'' bond, as shown below:

For example, for a simple reaction mixture containing 8 ``AB''-type monomers, the evolution of the reaction mixture might look something like this:

\subsection*{Critical Thinking Questions}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \label{ctq:ABtable} For the reaction mixture shown in Model 1, fill out the following table:
		
			\begin{table}[h]
				\centering
				\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
					\hline
					\textbf{Step} &  \textbf{Number of unreacted ``A'' groups} & \textbf{Number of molecules} \\\hline
					0 && \\\hline
					1 && \\\hline
					2 && \\\hline
					3 && \\\hline
					4 && \\\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
		
		\item Explain, in a complete sentence, how the number of molecules in the mixture is related to the number of unreacted ``A'' groups.
		
		\item The number-average degree of polymerization, $N_n$, is the total number of \emph{monomers} divided by the total number of \emph{molecules}.  Remembering that we started with 8 monomers, calculate the number-average degree of polymerization for each step shown in Model 1.
		
			\begin{table}[h]
				\centering
				\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
					\hline
					\textbf{~~Step~~} &  \textbf{~~~~0~~~~} & \textbf{~~~~1~~~~} & \textbf{~~~~2~~~~} & \textbf{~~~~3~~~~} & \textbf{~~~~4~~~~} \\\hline
					$\mathbf{N_n}$ &&&&& \\\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
		
		\item Suppose that you had initially started with 100 monomers.  Then, suppose that at some time later, you had only 8 unreacted ``A'' groups left.
		
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item How many molecules would there be in the reaction mixture at this point?
				
				\item What would the number-average degree of polymerization be at this point?
			\end{enumerate}
			
		\item More generally, suppose you started with $v_A^0$ monomers, and at some time later, you had only $v_A$ unreacted ``A'' groups left.  What would the number average-degree of polymerization be at this point, in terms of $v_A^0$ and $v_A$?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	INFORMATION: Usually, we find it more useful to work in terms of the \emph{fraction} of all ``A'' groups that have reacted, rather than the total \emph{number} of ``A'' groups that have reacted.  In step-growth polymerizations, we refer to the fraction of ``A'' groups that have reacted as the ``extent of reaction'', $p$.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item If we start with $v_A^0$ ``A'' groups, how many of the ``A'' groups will have \emph{reacted} when the extent of reaction is equal to $p$?
		
		\item How many ``A'' groups are still \emph{unreacted} when the extent of reaction is equal to $p$?
		
		\item Using your answers to critical thinking questions 5, 6, and 7, derive an expression for $N_n$ in terms of $p$.
		
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model 2: Polymerization of ``AA'' and ``BB''-Type Monomers}

Now, let's consider a slightly more complicated reaction, with two different types of monomers that each have \emph{either} two ``A'' reactive groups \emph{or} two ``B'' type reactive groups.
We call monomers with two ``A'' groups ``AA''-type monomers, and we call monomers with two ``B'' groups ``BB''-type monomers.

Suppose we start with 4 ``AA''-type monomers and 4 ``BB''-type monomers.
In this case, the evolution of the reaction mixture might look something like this:

\subsection*{Critical Thinking Questions}

	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item \label{ctq:AABBtable} For the reaction mixture shown in Model 2, fill out the following table:
		
			\begin{table}[!h]
				\centering
				\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
					\hline
					\textbf{Step} &  \textbf{Number of unreacted ``A'' groups} & \textbf{Number of molecules} & ~~~~$\mathbf{N_n}$~~~~\\\hline
					0 &&& \\\hline
					1 &&& \\\hline
					2 &&& \\\hline
					3 &&& \\\hline
					4 &&& \\\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
			
		\item Compare your answers in question \ref{ctq:AABBtable} with those from question \ref{ctq:ABtable}.  What similarities and/or differences do you notice?
		
		\item Consider the following statement:
		
			\emph{``In polymerizations of AA- and BB-type monomers, we should be able to use the same expressions to calculate $N_n$ as we did for polymerizations of AB-type monomers.''}
			
			In two or three complete sentences, briefly critique or defend this statement, making sure to explain your reasoning.
			
	\end{enumerate}
	
	INFORMATION: A reaction is \emph{stoichiometrically balanced} if the initial reaction mixture contains exactly the same number of ``A'' and ``B'' reactive groups.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item Are the reactions in Models 1 and 2 stoichiometrically balanced?  Briefly explain your answer in one or two complete sentences.
		
		\item Predict what the reaction mixtures in Models 1 and 2 might look like if you let them react until no more reactions could take place:
		
		\item Calculate the number-average degree of polymerization for both of the ``final'' states you drew in response to the previous question:
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model 3: A Stoichiometrically-Imbalanced Reaction Mixture}

Practically speaking, it is often very difficult to ensure that a reaction mixture is perfectly stoichiometrically-balanced, and there is often a small excess of one type of monomer or the other.

Consider a reaction mixture that starts with 3 AA-type monomers and 5 BB-type monomers:

\subsection*{Critical Thinking Questions}

	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item Fill in the blank spaces in the model, above, with reasonable predictions for what the reaction mixture might look like in each successive step.
		
		\item \label{ctq:nonstoichpredict} Predict what the reaction mixture in Model 3 might look like if you let it react until no more reactions could take place:
		
		\item Calculate the number-average degree of polymerization for the ``final'' state you drew in response to the previous question:
		
		\item Is the final degree of polymerization for this stoichiometrically-unbalanced reaction smaller than, equal to, or larger than the final degree of polymerization you calculated for the stoichiometrically-balanced reactions in Models 1 and 2?
		
		\item Which type of reactive group is on the ends of all of the chains you drew in question \ref{ctq:nonstoichpredict}?
		
		\item Briefly critique or defend the following statement:
		
			\emph{``When drawing the structure of a polymer produced by a step-growth polymerization, we should always make sure that we draw end groups consistent with whichever reactive species was present in excess.''}
			
	\end{enumerate}
	
	INFORMATION: In stoichiometrically-imbalanced step-growth polymerizations, we define a parameter $r$ that...
	
	For a reaction mixture with stoichiometric imbalance $r$ at extent of reaction $p$, the number-average degree of polymerization is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		N_n = \dots
	\end{equation*}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		%\item When $r=1$, how can you simplify this expression for $N_n$?		
		%\item When $p=1$, how can you simplify this expression for $N_n$?
		\item Using this expression, fill in the following table with the expected number-average degree of polymerization for different combinations of $r$ and $p$ values:
		
			\begin{table}[!h]
				\centering
				\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
					\hline
					 &  ~$p=0.9$~ & ~$p=0.99$~ & ~$p=0.999$~ \\\hline
					$r=0.9$ &&& \\\hline
					$r=0.99$ &&& \\\hline
					$r=0.999$ &&& \\\hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{table}
		
		\item On the basis of your answers to the previous question, briefly critique or defend the following statement:
		
			\emph{``Achieving high molecular weights in step-growth polymerizations requires both very precise measurement of the reagents, and reaction conditions which strongly favor the bond-forming reaction.''}
			
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercises}

	%After class, \textbf{read} the following sections of your textbook:
	
	%\begin{enumerate}
	%	\item First section
	%	\item Second section
	%\end{enumerate}
	
	%Then, do the following exercises:
	
	Continue with the following exercises if your group finishes the above activities before the end of class:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In this activity, we only calculated the number-average \emph{degree of polymerization} of the polymers produced in step-growth polymerizations. However, usually, we want to be able to calculate the \emph{molecular weight} of the polymers as well.
		
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item In Model 1, we considered a reaction of AB-type monomers.  If each monomer had mass $m_{AB}$, how would you calculate the number-average molecular weight, $M_n$, of the polymer produced when the extent of reaction is equal to $p$?
				
				\item In Model 2, we considered a stoichiometrically-balanced reaction of AA- and BB-type monomers. If the AA-type monomers each had mass $m_{AA}$ and the BB-type monomers each had mass $m_{BB}$, how would you calculate the number-average molecular weight of the polymer produced when the extent of reaction is equal to $p$?
				
					\emph{Note: this question is a little tricky - remember that $N_n$ counts \emph{monomers}, but in this reaction, not all of the monomers have the same molecular weight.  How might you be able to correct for this?}
				
			\end{enumerate}
		
		\item In Model 3, we considered a stoichiometrically-imbalanced reaction of AA- and BB-type monomers.  However, another important limit occurs when we have equal numbers of AA- and BB-type monomers, but add in an extra monofunctional reagent ``Bx'' that can only react on one side.
		
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item How many ``Bx'' molecules would you need to add to the reaction mixture to have the same number of extra ``B'' groups as you would get from a single extra BB-type monomer?
				
				\item (Modify stoich imbalance eqn to reflect this case?)
				
				\item Monofunctional reagents are a common impurity in supplies of difunctional monomers. Briefly explain why this means it is necessary to rigorously purify the starting materials used in step-growth polymerizations.
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
