	%\textbf{Focus question:} Put a central question for the students to consider through this exercise here.

\begin{model}[Synthesis of a Polyester]

	Esterification reactions are a common type of reaction used to produce polymers by step-growth polymerization.
	In a typical esterification reaction, an alcohol and a carboxylic acid react to form an ester bond:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_ester-general.pdf}}
	
	One example of a polymerization reaction using this chemistry is the synthesis of poly(6-hydroxycaproic acid) from 6-hydroxycaproic acid monomers:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_P6HCA.pdf}}

\end{model}


\begin{ctqs}

	\question The 6-hydroxycaproic acid monomer is shown below: \label{ctq:label-6hcpa}
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_6HCA.pdf}}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item As drawn, what type of functional group is on the \emph{left} side of the monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
					carboxylic acid (``acid'' is also fine)
				\end{solution}
			
			\item As drawn, what type of functional group is on the \emph{right} side of the monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
					alcohol (or hydroxyl)
				\end{solution}
		\end{enumerate}
		
\end{ctqs}

\begin{infobox}

	When a monomer used in a step-growth polymerization has different reactive functional groups on each end, it is called an ``AB-type'' monomer.
	
	When a monomer used in a step-growth polymerization has the same reactive functional group on each end, it is called an ``AA-type'' or ``BB-type'' monomer.

\end{infobox}

\begin{ctqs}
		
		\question Would you classify the poly(6-hydroxycaproic acid) monomer used in this synthesis as an AA-type monomer or an AB-type monomer?  Briefly explain your answer in 1-2 complete sentences.
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]
					This is an AB-type monomer, because it has two different reactive functional groups in the same monomer.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question The synthesis of a short 6-hydroxycaproic acid oligomer from three monomers is shown explicitly, below: \label{ctq:6hcpa-oligomer}
	
\vspace{0.25in}	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_3oligomer-explicit.pdf}}
The molecules are color-coded so that you can see which atoms in the oligomer came from which monomer.
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		
			\item Explain, in one or two complete sentences, why you think we classify this polymer as a ``polyester'':
			
				\begin{solution}[2in]
					We call this polymer a ``polyester'' because it has ester groups in the polymer backbone.
					
					Note: the fact that they are in the backbone is important; if the ester groups are only in the sidechains, the polymer is \emph{not} a polyester.
				\end{solution}
		
			\item Explain, in one or two complete sentences, why we generally abbreviate the product of this reaction as
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_3oligomer-shorthand.pdf}}
	
	rather than as
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_incorrect-shorthand.pdf}}
			
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					We use the first notation because all of the atoms in a single repeat unit come from the same monomer (if you draw these parentheses on the color-coded molecules at the beginning of the question, each pair of parentheses will only have one color of atoms in it).  This is not true for the second and third options.
				\end{solution}
	
			\item When we write the structure of this oligomer as
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_3oligomer-shorthand.pdf}}
	
	how many monomers make up each repeat unit in the polymer chain?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
					one
				\end{solution}
			
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\question Consider the following polymer:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{\figpath/model1_PMA.pdf}}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
		
			\item Would you be able to produce this polymer by esterification reactions of small molecules?  Why or why not?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.75in]
					No.  This polymer (poly(methyl acrylate)) contains ester bonds, but they are only in the sidechains, not the backbone.  But when we produce a polymer from esterification reactions of small molecules, the ester bonds end up in the polymer backbone.
					
					Put another way, the backbone in this polymer only contains carbon-carbon bonds, which cannot be formed by esterification reactions.
				\end{solution}
			
			\item Based on your answer to the previous question, would you classify this polymer as a polyester?  Why or why not?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]
					No, this is not a polyester because it does not contain ester bonds in the polymer backbone.
				\end{solution}
			
		\end{enumerate}
		
\end{ctqs}
	

\begin{model}[Synthesis of a Polyamide]

Amidation reactions are another type of reaction used to produce polymers by step-growth polymerizations.
For example, acid chlorides can be reacted with primary amines to form an amide bond:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_amide-general.pdf}}

Commercially, this reaction is used to produce Nomex, a heat-resistant polymer used in oven mitts and firefighters' protective clothing, among other applications.
A reaction scheme for the synthesis of Nomex is shown below:
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_Nomex.pdf}}

\end{model}

\begin{ctqs}
		\question Why is this polymer classified as a polyamide?
			
				\begin{solution}[2in]
					This polymer is classified as a polyamide because it has amide bonds in the polymer backbone.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question What functional groups does monomer 1 have?   Would you classify this monomer as an AA-type monomer or an AB-type monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.75in]
					Monomer 1 has two amine groups.  Because it has two of the same reactive group, it is an AA-type monomer.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question What functional groups does monomer 2 have?   Would you classify this monomer as an AA-type monomer or an AB-type monomer?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.75in]
					Monomer 2 has two acid chloride groups.  Because it has two of the same reactive group, it is an AA-type monomer.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question Explain, in one or two complete sentences, why we might describe this reaction as an ``AA+BB''-type polymerization:
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]
					This polymer is formed from two AA-type monomers.  Since the two monomers are chemically different, we distinguish them by calling one the ``AA-type'' monomer and the other a ``BB-type'' monomer; thus, we call the polymerization an ``AA+BB''-type polymerization.
					
					This reaction is notably different from the AB-type polymerization in Model 1 because it requires two chemically distinct monomers; in the AB-type polymerization in Model 1, we only needed one type of monomer.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question How many monomers make up each repeat unit?
			
				\begin{solution}[0.5in]
					two
				\end{solution}
		
		\question A very similar reaction can be used to make Kevlar, the high-strength polymer used in bulletproof vests and cut-resistant gloves.  Given that Kevlar is produced from the following two monomers,
		
	
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_Kevlar-monomers.pdf}}
		
		what do you predict the structure of the polymer should look like?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]
					\instructordisplay{\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_Kevlar.pdf}}}
				\end{solution}
		
		\question A similar chemistry can also be used to prepare nylon-6,6, a polymer used in many consumer goods.
		The structure of nylon-6,6 is shown below:
		
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_nylon66.pdf}}
			
		What two monomers would you need to combine to make this polymer?
			
				\begin{solution}[2in]
					\instructordisplay{\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{\figpath/model2_nylon66-monomers.pdf}}}
				\end{solution}
			
\end{ctqs}
	
\begin{infobox}

A polymerization reaction is called a \emph{condensation} polymerization if the reaction produces a small-molecule byproduct that is not part of the polymer chain.

\end{infobox}
	
\begin{ctqs}
		\question Is the esterification reaction in Model 1 a condensation polymerization?  If so, what is the small-molecule byproduct that is produced?
			
				\begin{solution}[1in]
					Yes, the reaction in Model 1 is a condensation polymerization. It produces \ce{H2O}.
				\end{solution}
		
		\question Is the amidation reaction in Model 2 a condensation polymerization?  If so, what is the small-molecule byproduct that is produced?
			
				\begin{solution}[1in]
					Yes, the reaction in Model 2 is a condensation polymerization. It produces \ce{HCl}.
				\end{solution}
		
\end{ctqs}

		\vspace{0.25in}
		\question Which of the above polymerization reactions would you classify as condensation polymerizations?
			
				\begin{solution}[2in]
					All of the reactions except for the epoxy reaction form a small-molecule byproduct, so all of the reactions except for the epoxy reaction are condensation polymerizations.
