\begin{model}[Probabilities of Forming Different Chain Lengths]

Suppose we perform a step-growth polymerization of AB-type monomers and stop the polymerization at extent of reaction $p$ (i.e. we stop the polymerization when the fraction of A groups that have reacted is equal to $p$).

Consider the following argument:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a given AB-type monomer ($i=1$), 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the probability that the A group has \textit{not} reacted, and the monomer remains an AB monomer, is $1-p$.  This is the same as the probability of forming a chain with \emph{exactly} one monomer; while

	\item the probability that the A group \textit{has} reacted, and has formed at least an AbaB dimer, is $p$.
\end{itemize}

\item Of the dimers ($i=2$),
\begin{itemize}
	\item the probability that the A end group remains unreacted (and the chain stops growing) is $1-p$. Thus the probability of forming a dimer that remains a dimer, or a chain with exactly 2 monomers, is $(1-p)$ times the probability of forming a dimer in the first place ($p$), for a total probability of $(1-p)p$; while

	\item the probability that the A end group on the dimer reacts to form at least a trimer is $p$, so the total probability of forming at least a trimer is $p^2$.
\end{itemize}

\item Of the trimers ($i=3$),
\begin{itemize}
	\item the probability that the A end group remains unreacted (and the chain stops growing) is again $1-p$.  Thus the total probability of forming a chain with exactly three monomers is $(1-p)$ times the probability of forming a trimer in the first place ($p^2$), for a total probability of $(1-p)p^2$; while
	\item the probability that the A end group reacts to form at least a tetramer is $p$, for a total probability of $p^3$.
\end{itemize}

%We can represent this tree of probabilities graphically as follows:

\begin{model}[$M_n$ and $M_w$ for Step-Growth Polymerizations]

	To calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$, we need to know $n_i$, or the total number of chains with $i$ monomers.
	
	If we started with $v_A^0$ monomers, then when the extent of reaction is equal to $p$, there will be $(1-p)v_A^0$ unreacted A groups left.  Recalling that the number of unreacted A groups is equal to the number of molecules in the reaction mixture, this lets us write
	\begin{align*}
		n_i &= \text{(mole fraction of molecules that have length }i\text{) x (number of molecules in reaction mixture)}\\
			%&= (x_i)((1-p)v_A^0)\\
			&= \left(p^{i-1}(1-p)\right)\left((1-p)v_A^0\right)\\
			&= p^{i-1}(1-p)^2v_A^0
	\end{align*}
	
	If we plug this expression into our equation for $M_n$, we get
	\begin{equation*}
		M_n = \frac{\sum_i n_i M_i}{\sum_i n_i} %= \frac{\sum_i p^{i-1}(1-p)^2 v_A^0 i M_0}{\sum_i p^{i-1}(1-p)^2 v_A^0} 
		= M_0\frac{\sum_i p^{i-1}(1-p)^2 i }{\sum_i p^{i-1}(1-p)^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $M_0$ is the molecular weight of the monomer ($M_i = M_0 i$).
	
	Evaluating these sums is a bit tedious, but if we do so, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		M_n = \frac{M_0}{1-p} && \text{or} && N_n = \frac{M_n}{M_0} = \frac{1}{1-p}
	\end{align*}
	which is exactly what we expected (whew - our math worked!).
	
	Similarly, if we plug this expression into our equation for $M_w$ and work through the sums, we get
	\begin{align*}
		M_w = \frac{\sum_i n_i M_i^2}{\sum_i n_i M_i} = M_0\frac{1+p}{1-p} && \text{or} && N_w = \frac{M_w}{M_0} = \frac{1+p}{1-p}
	\end{align*}
