The following diagram summarizes the steps that lead to different chain lengths in a step-growth polymerization of AB-type monomers at extent of reaction $p$:

In this diagram, the different \textbf{states} of the polymer chain are written in bold text.  They are connected by arrows describing the \textbf{processes} that take the chain from one state to the next; the text \emph{above} each arrow describes which process takes place, while the expression \emph{under} each arrow gives the probability of that process occurring.







\question What is the probability that...
	
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ... an AB monomer does not react, and remains an AB monomer?
	
			\begin{solution}[0.25in]
				$1-p$
			\end{solution}

		\item ... an AB monomer reacts to form an AbaB dimer?
	
			\begin{solution}[0.25in]
				$p$
			\end{solution}
		
		\item ... an AbaB dimer does not react, and remains an AbaB dimer?
	
			\begin{solution}[0.25in]
				$1-p$
			\end{solution}
	
		
		\item ... an AbaB dimer reacts to form an AbabaB trimer?
	
			\begin{solution}[0.25in]
				$p$

	\question For \emph{any} molecule with $n$ monomers, what is the probability that it reacts to form a molecule with $n+1$ monomers?
	
			\begin{solution}[0.25in]
				$p$
			\end{solution}
	
	\question Is your answer to the previous question consistent with the definition of the extent of reaction $p$?  Briefly explain your answer in 1-2 complete sentences.
	
		\begin{solution}[2in]
			Yes, it is.  The extent of reaction, $p$, is the fraction of ``A'' groups that have reacted.  Since each molecule has exactly 1 ``A'' group, the fraction of molecules that reach length $n$ whose ``A'' groups react to form chains with $n+1$ monomers is $p$.  This fraction is equivalent to the probability that the chain grows from $n$ to $n+1$ monomers.

	For a process with a \textbf{single} step, the overall probability of reaching the final state is just the probability of that step.
	
	For example, the series of steps that leads to a chain with exactly one monomer (i.e. an AB monomer that does not react) is shown below:
	
	\vspace{0.1in}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{\figpath/model1-AB}}
	
	Since there is only a single step in this process, the overall probability of obtaining a chain with exactly 1 monomer is just the probability of this step, or $1-p$.
	
	\vspace{0.1in}
	For processes with \textbf{multiple} steps, the overall probability of reaching the final state is the \emph{product} of the probabilities for each step in the process.
	
	For example, the series of steps takes us from an initial AB monomer to an AbaB chain that does not react further (remains a chain with exactly 2 monomers) is:
	
	\vspace{0.1in}
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{\figpath/model1-AbaB}}
	
	The first step occurs with probability $p$, while the second step occurs with probability $1-p$; the total probability of obtaining a chain with exactly 2 monomers is the product of these probabilities, or $p(1-p)$.

		}\end{solution}
	
	\question Based on your diagram, what is the overall probability of obtaining a chain with exactly 3 monomers?
	
		\begin{solution}[1in]
			$p \cdot p \cdot (1-p) = p^2(1-p)$
		\end{solution}

				1 & $1-p$\\\hline
				2 & $p(1-p)$\\\hline
				3 & \answer{$p^2(1-p)$}\\\hline
				4 & \answer{$p^3(1-p)$}\\\hline
				5 & \answer{$p^4(1-p)$}\\\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	
	\question What pattern do you notice in these values?  Briefly describe your observations in 1-2 complete sentences.
	
		\begin{solution}[1in]
		
			The values acquire an additional factor of $p$ for each additional monomer in the chain.
