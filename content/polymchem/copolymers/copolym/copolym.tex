\begin{model}[Simulation Activity]
	\label{\labelbase:mdl:simulation}

	In copolymerizations, in which two different types of monomers are simultaneously incorporated into the same chain, the relative reactivities of the monomers can have a big impact on the polymer microstructure.
	
	Simulate a fully random copolymerization by doing the following:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Set-up the simulation:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Place two cups, each filled with a different color of beads, within reach of all members of your group.  Designate one color ``color A'' and the other ``color B''.
				\item Open a random number generator app on your phone and set it to generate numbers between 0 and 1 to two decimal places.  \emph{Alternatively,} obtain a sheet of random numbers from your instructor.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Synthesize a random polymer chain:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Pick up a bead of either color.
				\item Generate a random number (or, read the next random number off the list).  Each student in the group should get a different random number.
				\item Add a new bead to the end of the chain according to the following rules:
					\begin{center}
					\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
					\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
						\hline
						\textbf{If the last bead was...} &  \textbf{then add an ``A'' bead if} & \textbf{or add a ``B'' bead if}\\\hline
						 an ``A'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.5$ & Number is $> 0.5$ \\
						 a ``B'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.5$ & Number is $> 0.5$ \\\hline
					\end{tabular}
					\end{center}
				\item Repeat steps (b) and (c) until your chain is 30 beads long.
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{model}


\begin{ctqs}

	\question Record the sequence of the beads in your chain below.  Shade in the circles corresponding to ``A'' beads, and leave circles corresponding to ``B'' beads blank.
	
		\vspace{6pt}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_blank.pdf}}
	
	\question Compare your polymer sequence to those of your group-mates.  What type of sequence (random, alternating, blocky) did this polymerization generally produce?
		
		\begin{solution}[1.25in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question Repeat the process in Model 1 using the following rules:	\begin{center}
					\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
					\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
						\hline
						\textbf{If the last bead was...} &  \textbf{then add an ``A'' bead if} & \textbf{or add a ``B'' bead if}\\\hline
						 an ``A'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.2$ & Number is $> 0.2$ \\
						 a ``B'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.8$ & Number is $> 0.8$ \\\hline
					\end{tabular}
					\end{center}
	
		Then, as before, do the following:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Record the sequence of the beads in your chain below.  Shade in the circles corresponding to ``A'' beads, and leave circles corresponding to ``B'' beads blank.
	
		\vspace{6pt}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_blank.pdf}}
	
			\item Compare your polymer sequence to those of your group-mates.  What type of sequence (random, alternating, blocky) did this polymerization generally produce?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]
				\end{solution}
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\question Repeat the process in Model 1 again, this time using the following rules:	\begin{center}
					\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
					\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
						\hline
						\textbf{If the last bead was...} &  \textbf{then add an ``A'' bead if} & \textbf{or add a ``B'' bead if}\\\hline
						 an ``A'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.8$ & Number is $> 0.8$ \\
						 a ``B'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.2$ & Number is $> 0.2$ \\\hline
					\end{tabular}
					\end{center}
	
		Then, as before, do the following:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Record the sequence of the beads in your chain below.  Shade in the circles corresponding to ``A'' beads, and leave circles corresponding to ``B'' beads blank.
	
		\vspace{6pt}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_blank.pdf}}
		
			\item Compare your polymer sequence to those of your group-mates.  What type of sequence (random, alternating, blocky) did this polymerization generally produce?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.5in]
				\end{solution}
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question Repeat the process in Model 1 one final time using the following rules:	\begin{center}
					\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
					\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
						\hline
						\textbf{If the last bead was...} &  \textbf{then add an ``A'' bead if} & \textbf{or add a ``B'' bead if}\\\hline
						 an ``A'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.2$ & Number is $> 0.2$ \\
						 a ``B'' bead & Number is $\leq 0.2$ & Number is $> 0.2$ \\\hline
					\end{tabular}
					\end{center}
	
		Then, as before, do the following:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Record the sequence of the beads in your chain below.  Shade in the circles corresponding to ``A'' beads, and leave circles corresponding to ``B'' beads blank.
	
		\vspace{6pt}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figpath/Model1_blank.pdf}}
	
			\item Compare your polymer sequence to those of your group-mates.  What type of sequence (random, alternating, blocky) did this polymerization generally produce?
			
				\begin{solution}[1.25in]
				\end{solution}
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\question In which of the simulations did the monomers have the strongest preference for adding monomers of the \emph{same} type?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.85in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question In which of the simulations did the monomers have the strongest preference for adding monomers of the \emph{other} type?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.85in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question In which of the simulations did the monomers not ``care'' what type of monomer came before them?
	
		\begin{solution}[0.85in]
		\end{solution}
	
	\question In 2-3 complete sentences, describe how the preference of the monomers for adding monomers of the same or different types influences the type of sequence obtained in the copolymerization.
	
		\begin{solution}[2in]

\end{ctqs}

\begin{model}[Kinetics of Copolymerization]

	In a copolymerization reaction of monomers $M_1$ and $M_2$, there are four possible propagation steps, each with their own rate constant.  These propagation steps are:
	
	\begin{center}
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.8}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Reaction} & \textbf{Rate Law} \\\hline
			$-M_1^\bullet + M_1 \xlongrightarrow{k_{11}} -M_1M_1^\bullet$ & $R_{p,11} = k_{11}[-M_1^\bullet][M_1]$ \\\hline
			$-M_1^\bullet + M_2 \xlongrightarrow{k_{12}} -M_1M_2^\bullet$ & $R_{p,12} = k_{12}[-M_1^\bullet][M_2]$ \\\hline
			$-M_2^\bullet + M_1 \xlongrightarrow{k_{21}} -M_2M_1^\bullet$ & $R_{p,21} = k_{21}[-M_2^\bullet][M_1]$ \\\hline
			$-M_2^\bullet + M_2 \xlongrightarrow{k_{22}} -M_2M_2^\bullet$ & $R_{p,22} = k_{22}[-M_2^\bullet][M_2]$ \\\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

\end{model}


%\begin{exercises}
%	\exercise In practice, the relative probability of addding a monomer depends not only on the kinetics of addition, but also on the relative concentrations of the monomers.  If the monomer has a high tendency to react with itself but the concentration of the monomer is very low, for example, the “effective probability” of addition will be low.
