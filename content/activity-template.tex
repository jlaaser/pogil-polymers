\begin{infobox}
	Here is some useful information that might help the students with the next few critical thinking questions.
	In some cases, it might include an equation:
	\begin{equation*}
		a^2 + b^2 = c^2
	\end{equation*}
	or even more than one equation:
	\begin{equation*}
		x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
	\end{equation*}
